## Accelerometer and G Forces

The area that is to be built on here is when a collision happens. 
We use the accelerometer to measure G Forces before and during the collision. 
This will be a parameter for our reinforcement learning model.

Not sure how far this will go. In my mind, I would prefer to have Claire scan a room before she starts moving around in it.
