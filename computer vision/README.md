# Claire must also obey traffic lights

## Through webcam vision, Claire will stop when a mini traffic light is showing red. 

##### Also we don't want claire to come to a complete stop once she first picks up a red light. Ideally we would get the shape of the traffic light. When this shape increases we are getting closer to the line and light.
